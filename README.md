spring-jpetstore
================

JPetStore 6 is a full web application built on top of Spring, Spring MVC, MyBatis 3, and Spring Security. 
This is another implementation of MyBatis sample application (https://github.com/mybatis/jpetstore-6).

Original application is available for downloading in the downloads section of MyBatis project site. 

In this section we will walk through this sample to understand how is it built and learn how to run it.

Removed line from the readme file.

Trying to see if I can see status update on pull request.
